        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a student of University of Washington majoring in Political Economy. Although my major is the degrre of the Art, my study area is actually statistical analysis of the world, which began when I studied the quantum physics in Japan.

        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <p>
            I'm obsessed with data analysis of political economy right now. Recently, I focus on how the governmental balance sheet works.
            There are a lot of other topics that I engaged and am engaging in: statistical analysis on premier league, the Japanese politics and bureaucracy, and etc.
